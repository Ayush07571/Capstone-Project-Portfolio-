        Hello, my self <strong>Ayush Karan</strong>. I am a aspiring web developer. I am currently learning web development and trying to improve my skills. I am currently pursuing BTech. in Computer Science and Enginnering specialization in Cloud Computing and Automation at <a href="https://vitbhopal.ac.in/">VIT Bhopal University</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a passionate learner and always eager to learn new things. I like to work in coordination with a team and especially when the team is working on a project that is beneficial to the society. I am also good at problem solving and I like to solve problems in a creative way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/rtTI1rh9U5M?si=OTSkm5LEskx9L9NV" target="_blank"> lo-fi music</a> while studying or coding mostly but some times I prefer some other genre like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w--g30WTfBs&list=RDw--g30WTfBs&start_radio=1" target="_blank"> YouTube mix</a> or some BGMs. I also enjoy sitting infront of screen thinking about solution to a specific coding problem and also thinking about solution to an error or way to solve any problem until I get the solution even while I am doing some other work.
